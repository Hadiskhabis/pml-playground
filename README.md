# About

This repository is playground and testbed for experimenting with [PML]  (Practical Markup Language), a new [lightweight markup language] created by [Christian Neumanns].

The project is open to all PML pioneers who are willing to experiment with this wonderful newborn language and documentation system — the lucky few who will have the chance to shape PML's future, by exploring its potential and proposing new features while the language is still growing.

# License

Since this project is open to contributions and makes extensive use of third party assets, it doesn't have a project wide license.
Each individual asset is governed by its own license, as indicated in the source files or its `LICENSE` file (if present).
