Experimenting with PML CSS files via [Sass].

> **NEWS** — The stylesheets sub-project now uses the new [new CSS related options] introduced in PMLC 3.x, which allow overriding the default stylesheets with custom `.css` files, which has improved its Rake automation.

# Directory Contents

- [`/_shared/`][_shared/] — assets shared by all test docs.
- [`/css__default/`][css__default/] — PML default CSS tests.
- [`/css__default-new/`][css__default-new/] — PML experimental new default CSS (WIP).
- [`/src-docs/`][src-docs/] — test docs sources (PML).
- [`fetch.bat`][fetch.bat] — fetch latest [default PML stylesheets] from [pml-companion] repository using cURL:
    + [`pml-default.css`][pml-default.css]
    + [`pml-print-default.css`][pml-print-default.css]
- [`HTML_TEMPLATE.md`][HTML_TEMPLATE.md] — Info about PML default HTML template.

> **WARNING!** — The generated CSS files and HTML documents are not tracked by Git, so in order to view the test documents you'll have to build them locally via Rake.


# Building

The tests in this folder are controlled via the `css` Rake task (included in default task).

To build just the samples:

    rake css

or, to force-rebuild them:

    rake css -B


# How Tests Work

The tests system in this directory is designed to allow contributors to add new stylesheets or test documents without having to tweak the main `Rakefile`.

The `Rakefile` is driven by rules based on pattern-matching naming conventions, so as long as you abide to the following descriptions you can add new assets to this directory and they will be immediately automated.

## Stylesheet Folders

Every folder with a name starting in `css__` contains a different set of stylesheets (one or more) to be tested. All `*.css` files found within a stylesheet folder will be used when building the test HTML documents — i.e. having separate CSS files it's just a matter of convenience.

You are not meant to create any `*.css` files directly: instead work on the Sass sources (`*.scss`), and let Rake create each CSS stylesheet automatically from it.

> **WARNING!** — All `*.css` files within this directory will be automatically deleted (and _lost_) when the project is clobbered (i.e. `rake clobber`).

Sass sources can be arbitrarily named, and their filename will determine the name of the final CSS stylesheet since the two will only differ in their file extension:

- `<filename>.scss` &rarr; `<filename>.css`

You can add to each stylesheet directory as many Sass modules (`_*.scss`) as you like, and even organize them into subfolders. Rake will track changes to any Sass modules, along with Sass sources, and whenever a module has changed it will rebuild the entire stylesheet directory.

The [`/css__default/`][css__default/] folder is a special case, since its Sass sources simply import the default PML stylesheets found in the root folder of the stylesheets project:

- [`pml-default.css`][pml-default.css]
- [`pml-print-default.css`][pml-print-default.css]

Currently, it's just intended for study and comparison with other custom CSS files.


## Test Documents

Any `*.pml` document inside the [`/src-docs/`][src-docs/] folder will be converted to HTML into each and every `css__*/` stylesheet folder using the CSS files found within the latter, so that each stylesheet can be tested using the same documents.

> **NOTE** — The PMLC output HTML documents are post-processed by our `Rakefile` to eliminate the `css/` prefix in CSS paths in order to use the original CSS files generated by Sass, instead of their copies which PMLC creates within the `css/` subfolder (see [Issue #93]).
>
> This hackish workaround allows us to keep to CSS stylesheets together with the Sass-generated `.css.map` files and benefit from full CSS-to-Sass debugging when inspecting the test documents in the browser Dev Tools (tested with Chrome browser) — a feature which we definitely _can't_ do without in this type of project.

Rake will track any changes to the test documents sources, along with their assets (in [`/_shared/`][_shared/]) and update any file tasks as required.

Test documents should be created as a single `.pml` source file, and any required dependencies should be added to the [`/_shared/`][_shared/] directory instead, so that Rake can track their changes — assets include reusable PML file snippets, images, JavaScript, etc.
Any files within the [`/_shared/`][_shared/] directory tree (i.e. sub-folders included) will be considered by Rake as requirements (dependencies) of the PML test documents, with the exception of Markdown files (`.md`) which will be ignored.


# Dependencies

To build the assets in this folder you'll also need [Dart Sass].
